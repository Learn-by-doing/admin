## Usage
#
#   $ npm install
#
# And then you can run various commands:
#
#   $ make            # compile files that need compiling
#   $ make clean all  # remove target files and recompile from scratch
#

## Variables
BIN=node_modules/.bin
PUBLIC=docs

# Targets
#
# The format goes:
#
#   target: list of dependencies
#     commands to build target
#
# If something isn't re-compiling double-check the changed file is in the
# target's dependencies list.

# Phony targets - these are for when the target-side of a definition
# (such as "all" below) isn't a file but instead a just label. Declaring
# it as phony ensures that it always run, even if a file by the same name
# exists.
.PHONY: all copy

all: copy

copy:
	# Fonts:
	mkdir -p $(PUBLIC)/fonts/OpenSans
	cp -r node_modules/open-sans-fontface/fonts/**/* $(PUBLIC)/fonts/OpenSans/
